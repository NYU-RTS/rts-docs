# Introduction to High-Performance Computing

This tutorial is an introduction to using the Greene high-performance computing systems at NYU effectively. It is not intended to be an exhaustive course on parallel programming.  The goal is to give new users of Greene an introduction and overview of the tools available and how to use them effectively.

:::warning[Prerequisites]
Command line experience is necessary for this lesson. We recommend the participants to go through our [Introduction to Using the Shell on Greene](../13_tutorial_intro_shell_hpc/01_intro.mdx), if new to the command line (also known as terminal or shell).

:::note[Objectives]
By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:
-   Identify problems a cluster can help solve
-   Use the UNIX shell (also known as terminal or command line) to connect to a cluster.
-   Transfer files onto a cluster.
-   Submit and manage jobs on a cluster using a scheduler.
-   Observe the benefits and limitations of parallel execution.
