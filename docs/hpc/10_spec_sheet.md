Torch was tested in June 2025 using the [LINPACK benchmark system](https://top500.org/project/linpack/), which is the basis for all HPC systems ranked on the Top500 list. It had a theoretical maximum performance of 12.25 PF/s thanks to its powerful GPU resources, of which LINPACK was able to use 10.79 PF/s, thus placing it at [#133 on the listed](https://top500.org/system/180363/).

 Torch was recently ranked [#40 on the Green 500 list](https://top500.org/lists/green500/list/2025/06/), a global list of the most energy efficient supercomputers in the world thanks to its advanced liquid cooling system.
