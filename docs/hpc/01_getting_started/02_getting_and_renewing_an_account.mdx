This section deals with the eligibility for getting HPC accounts, the process to create new accounts, renew existing ones, touches on access policies after graduation from NYU, and access for non-NYU researchers.

:::info

-   All **sponsored accounts** will be created for a period of 12 months, at which point a renewal process is required to continue to use the clusters
-   Faculty, students and staff from the **NYU School of Medicine** require the sponsorship of an eligible NYU faculty member to access the NYU HPC clusters
-   **Non-NYU Researchers** who are collaborating with NYU researchers must obtain an affiliate status before applying for an NYU HPC account
-   An HPC account gives you access to Torch, but an active allocation within the HPC projects management portal gives you access to a SLURM account which is needed to run jobs on Torch. More information on using the HPC project management portal can be found [here](./07_hpc_project_management_portal.mdx)

:::

## Who is eligible for an NYU HPC account ?

NYU HPC clusters and related resources are available to full-time NYU faculty and to all NYU staff and students with sponsorship from a full-time NYU faculty.




## Getting a new account on the NYU HPC clusters

To request an NYU HPC account please log in to [NYU Identity Management service][nyu ims link] and follow the link to "Request HPC account" by clicking on the hamburger icon on the top left of the page and selecting "Manage Access" . We have a walkthrough of how to [request an account through IIQ](03_walkthrough_request_hpc_account.mdx). If you are a student, alumni or an external collaborator you will need an NYU faculty sponsor.

## Renewing HPC account

Each year, non-faculty users must renew their HPC account by filling in the account renewal form from the [NYU Identity Management service][nyu ims link]. See [Renewing your HPC account](05_walkthrough_renew_hpc_account.md) for a walkthrough of the process.

## Information for faculty who sponsor HPC users

All full-time NYU faculty members (other than NYU Med School) are eligible to become sponsors and in turn can sponsor:

-   NYU Degree program students

-   Scholars visiting NYU

-   NYU Research staff

-   NYU School of Medicine faculty, staff and students

-   Other NYU staff/affiliates with a NetID

-   Non-NYU researchers with whom they are actively collaborating

If you need to sponsor an HPC account for an external collaborator (for example, for an NYU alumnus), please, request that they become a "research affiliate". You can find the instructions at https://start.nyu.edu/.

You can request a NetID for your student(s) or collaborator(s) at https://start.nyu.edu/pwm/public/. The request form has additional information about affiliates.

HPC faculty sponsors are expected to:

-   Approve/disapprove sponsored users' association with you

-   Approve/disapprove the purpose for which user is requesting an account on NYU HPC resources

-   Agree to supervise the sponsored individual, to the extent necessary, to ensure proper use of the NYU HPC resource and compliance with all applicable policies

-   Respond promptly to account-related requests from HPC staff

Each year, your sponsored users must renew their account. You will need to approve the renewal by logging into the [NYU Identity Management service][nyu ims link]. We have a [walkthrough of the approval process here](04_walkthrough_approve_hpc_account_request.md)

## Bulk HPC Accounts for Courses

HPC bulk accounts request is disabled for HPC sponsors.

-   If you would like to use JupyterHub for your classes, please don't submit the form below, read the [Jupyter Hub section of the Instructional Tools for Coding Page](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/teaching-and-learning-services/instructional-tools/instructional-tools-for-coding.html?challenge=d06e90d7-4d8f-4b88-9d8c-10b73beb60f1) instead (the link to an intake form is also there)

-   Please fill out this [request form][hpc account request form link for courses] for the course, we'll create HPC accounts for the class per request
:::note
Accounts created for courses last until the end of the semester, rather than a full year.

## Getting an account with one of NYU partners

\[NYU partners with many state and national facilities](**TODO:link to list**) with a variety of HPC systems and expertise. 

[Contact us](email:hpc@nyu.edu) for assistance setting up a collaboration with any of these.
--->

## Non-NYU Researchers

If you are collaboratng with NYU researchers you will need to obtain **affiliate** status before applying for an NYU HPC account. A full-time NYU faculty member must sponsor a non-NYU collaborator for affiliate status.

Please see [instructions for affiliate management][affiliate and account management link] (NYU NetID login is required to follow the link). [Please read instructions about sponsoring external collaborators here](06_hpc_accounts_external_collaborators.md).


## Access to cluster after Graduation

If you will need to work on a project with an NYU researchers after graduation - refer to the section above for "Non-NYU Researchers"

If you are not part of a collaboration, your access to the cluster will end with your NetID becoming non-active. Please copy all your data from the cluster (if you need any) before that time.


## VPN on a Linux machine

In order to request a new HPC account or renew an expired one, you need to be connected to the NYU VPN if you are working remotely, Please see [instructions on how to install and use the NYU VPN][nyu vpn link].

:::tip
Linux clients are not officially supported, however we were able to successfully use openVPN client. Here are installation and connection instructions for a debian linux distribution with apt package manager:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="anyconnect" label="anyconnect" default>
  -   Download the VPN package from [here](https://cdn.shanghai.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/anyconnect-core-linux64-4.10.07061.zip) and unzip the file;
  -   Type the following command in the Terminal
      ```sh
      sudo sh anyconnect-core-linux64-4.10.07061.sh
      ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="openconnect" label="openconnect">
  -   Type the following command in the Terminal
      ```sh
      apt-get install openconnect
      sudo openconnect -b vpn.nyu.edu
      ```
  - When prompted follow the instructions and provide your netID, password, and authenticate with ('push', 'phone1' or 'sms')
  This method was tested on few Linux distributions and settings however is not guaranteeed to work in future.
