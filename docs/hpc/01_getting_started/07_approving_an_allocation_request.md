You should click "Details" instead of just "Approve" button if you'd like to set more details.

After clicking "Details", now you'll see Allocation information part to fill in with your approval.
Here, you could set start date, end date, description, etc.
If you're done with adding the information, you could click "Update" button to update the allocation request with the information you put.
