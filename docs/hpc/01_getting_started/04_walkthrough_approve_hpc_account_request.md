When someone nominates you as their HPC sponsor, you should be notified by email. You can also [log into IIQ at any time](https://iiq.nyu.edu/identityiq), and if you have a request awaiting your approval, it will appear in your "Actions Items" box, as per the following screenshot:

Another way to get to pending approvals is to click on the line item in the “Latest Approvals” section which will lead directly to the approval page. For new HPC Account Requests, the page will look like this:

Here, the Approve or Deny button should be clicked, then confirmed, in order to complete the request.

For HPC Account Renewals, the page will look like this:

Here, all systems should be selected by clicking the check box in the menu bar, and choosing “Select Everything”.

Then, the “Select Bulk Action” menu is used to Approve or Reject all items selected.  Please note that the line items may span multiple pages and all items must be acted upon in order to complete the request. Clicking “Complete” will complete the request.
