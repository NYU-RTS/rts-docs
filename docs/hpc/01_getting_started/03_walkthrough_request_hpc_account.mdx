  with “QuickLinks” to both “Bulk HPC Account Request” and “Request HPC Account” and will show any recent or pending approvals or forms.

  If the **Request HPC Account** QuickLink is clicked, the following form appears:
  ![Faculty request form](./static/faculty_request_form.png)

  The user’s name will be prepopulated, and the forms required fields must be completed (sponsor, reason for request, consent to terms of use).  After clicking “Submit” the chosen sponsor will be notified of the request and provisioning will only occur after approval.

  If the **Bulk HPC Account Request** QuickLink is clicked, the following form appears:
  ![Bulk account request form](./static/bulk_acct_req_form.png)

  The requestor’s name will be prepopulated, and the forms required fields must be completed (sponsor, list of netids, course identifier, reason for request, consent to terms of use).   These requests are auto-approved since they are usually submitted by the sponsor themselves or a member of the HPC Admin team.
