# Transferring Cloud Storage Data with rclone

## Transferring files to and from Google Drive with RCLONE
Having access to Google Drive from the HPC environment provides an option to archive data and even share data with collaborators who have no access to the NYU HPC environment. Other options to archiving data include the HPC Archive file system and using [Globus](./04_globus.md) to share data with collaborators.

Access to Google Drive is provided by [rclone](https://rclone.org/drive/) - rsync for cloud storage - a command line program to sync files and directories to and from cloud storage systems such as Google Drive, Amazon Drive, S3, B2 etc. [rclone](https://rclone.org/drive/) is available on Greene cluster as a module, the module versions currently (March 2025) available are:
- **rclone/1.68.2**
- **rclone/1.66.0**
- **rclone/1.60.1**

For more details on how to use rclone to sync files to Google Drive, please see: [RClone documentation for Google Drive](https://rclone.org/drive/)

rclone can be invoked in one of the three modes:
-   [Copy](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) mode to just copy new/changed files
-   [Sync](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/) (one way) mode to make a directory identical
-   [Check](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/) mode to check for file hash equality

Please try with these options: 
```sh
rclone --transfers=32 --checkers=16 --drive-chunk-size=16384k --drive-upload-cutoff=16384k copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath
```

This option works great for file sizes 1Gb+ to 250GB. Keep in mind that there is a rate limiting of 2 files/sec for upload into Google Drive.  Small file transfers donâ€™t work that well. If you have many small jobs, please tar the parent directory of such folders and split the tar file into 100GB chunks and then uploads then into Google Drive.

## rclone Configuration
You need to configure rclone before you will be able to move files between the HPC Environment and Google Drive

There are specific instruction on the [rclone web site](https://rclone.org/drive/) and here is an example of the process for configuring rclone for use on Greene:

### Step 1: Login to Greene:

Follow [instructions](../02_connecting_to_hpc/01_connecting_to_hpc.md) to log into the Greene HPC cluster.

### Step 2: Load the rclone module
```sh
$ module load rclone/1.68.2
```

### Step 3: Configure rclone

Configuring rclone and setting up remote access to your Google Drive, using the command:
```sh
$ rclone config
```

This will try to open the config files and you will see the below content:

You can select one of the options (here we show how to set up a new remote)
```sh
2025/03/14 16:39:23 NOTICE: Config file "/Users/rjy1/.config/rclone/rclone.conf" not found - using defaults
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
```

Please enter `n` to create a new remote

```sh
Enter name for new remote.

### Step 4: Transfer

Sample commands:
```sh
$ rclone lsd nyu_google_drive:
```

Transferring files to Google Drive, using the command below:
```sh
$ rclone copy <source_folder> <remote_name>:<name_of_folder_on_gdrive>
```

It looks something like below:
```sh
$ rclone copy /home/user1 nyu_google_drive:backup_home_user1
```

### Step 5: Confirmation

The files are transferred and you can find the files on your Google Drive.

:::note
Rclone only copies new files or files different from the already existing files on Google Drive.
