# Available storage systems

The NYU HPC clusters are served by the following storage systems:

## Flash Tier Storage (VAST)
An all flash file-system, using [VAST Flash storage](https://www.vastdata.com/), is available as the primary file-system for Torch. Flash storage is optimal for computational workloads with high I/O rates.


## Research Project Space (RPS)
[Research Project Space (RPS)](./05_research_project_space.mdx) volumes provide working spaces for sharing data and code amongst project or lab members.
-   RPS directories are available on the Torch HPC cluster.
-   There is no old-file purging policy on RPS.
-   RPS is backed up. 
-   There is a cost per TB per year and inodes per year for RPS volumes.

Please see [Research Project Space](./05_research_project_space.mdx) for more information.
