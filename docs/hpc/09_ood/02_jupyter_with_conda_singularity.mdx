# Jupyter with Conda/Singularity in OOD

## OOD + Singularity + conda
This page describes how to use your Singularity with conda environment in OOD GUI at Greene. 

### Log Into Greene via the Terminal
The following commands must be run from the terminal. Information on accessing via the terminal can be found at [Connecting to the HPC](../02_connecting_to_hpc/01_connecting_to_hpc.mdx) or you can log into OOD and select the `Clusters` tab at the top of the page and select `Greene Shell Access`.

### Preinstallation Warning
:::warning
If you have initialized Conda in your base environment, your prompt on Greene may show something like:
```bash
(base) [NetID@log-1 ~]$
```
then you must first comment out or remove this portion of your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
# >>> conda initialize >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$('/share/apps/anaconda3/2020.07/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/share/apps/anaconda3/2020.07/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/share/apps/anaconda3/2020.07/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
    else
        export PATH="/share/apps/anaconda3/2020.07/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda initialize <<<
```

The above code automatically makes your environment look for the default shared installation of Conda on the cluster and will sabotage  any attempts to install packages to a Singularity environment. Once removed or commented out, log out and back into the cluster for a fresh environment.

### Prepare Overlay File 
```bash
[NetID@log-1 ~]$ mkdir /scratch/$USER/my_env
[NetID@log-1 ~]$ cd /scratch/$USER/my_env
[NetID@log-1 my_env]$ cp -rp /scratch/work/public/overlay-fs-ext3/overlay-15GB-500K.ext3.gz .
[NetID@log-1 my_env]$ gunzip overlay-15GB-500K.ext3.gz
```
Above we used the overlay file `overlay-15GB-500K.ext3.gz` which will contain all of the installed packages. There are more optional overlay files. You can find instructions on the following pages: [Singularity with Conda](../07_containers/03_singularity_with_conda.md), [Squash File System and Singularity](../07_containers/04_squash_file_system_and_singularity.md). 

### Launch Singularity Environment for Installation
```bash
[NetID@log-1 ~]$ singularity exec --overlay /scratch/$USER/my_env/overlay-15GB-500K.ext3:rw /scratch/work/public/singularity/cuda12.3.2-cudnn9.0.0-ubuntu-22.04.4.sif /bin/bash
```
Above we used the Singularity OS image `cuda12.3.2-cudnn9.0.0-ubuntu-22.04.4.sif` which provides the base operating system environment for the conda environment. There are other Singularity OS images available at `/scratch/work/public/singularity`

Launching Singularity with the `--overlay` flag mounts the overlay file to a new directory: `/ext3` - you will notice that when not using Singularity `/ext3` is not available.

:::warning
Be sure that you have the Singularity prompt (`Singularity>`) and that `/ext3` is available before the next step.
```bash
Singularity> ls -lah /ext3
total 8.5K
drwxrwxr-x.  2 root root 4.0K Oct 19 10:01 .
drwx------. 29 root root 8.0K Oct 19 10:01 ..
```

### Install Miniforge to Overlay File
```bash
Singularity> wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
Singularity> sh Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /ext3/miniforge3
```
Next, create a wrapper script at `/ext3/env.sh`:
```bash
Singularity> touch /ext3/env.sh
Singularity> echo '#!/bin/bash' >> /ext3/env.sh
Singularity> echo 'unset -f which' >> /ext3/env.sh
Singularity> echo 'source /ext3/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh' >> /ext3/env.sh
Singularity> echo 'export PATH=/ext3/miniforge3/bin:$PATH'         >> /ext3/env.sh
Singularity> echo 'export PYTHONPATH=/ext3/miniforge3/bin:$PATH'   >> /ext3/env.sh
```
Your `/ext3/env.sh` file should now contain the following:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
unset -f which
source /ext3/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
export PATH=/ext3/miniforge3/bin:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=/ext3/miniforge3/bin:$PATH
```
The wrapper script will activate your conda environment, to which you will be installing your packages and dependencies. 

Next, activate your conda environment with the following:
```bash
Singularity> source /ext3/env.sh
```

### Install Packages to Miniforge Environment
Now that your environment is activated, you can update and install packages:
```bash
Singularity> conda config --remove channels defaults
Singularity> conda update -n base conda -y
Singularity> conda clean --all --yes
Singularity> conda install pip --yes
Singularity> conda install ipykernel --yes # Note: ipykernel is required to run as a kernel in the Open OnDemand Jupyter Notebooks
```
To confirm that your environment is appropriately referencing your Miniforge installation, try out the following:
```bash
Singularity> unset which
Singularity> which conda
# output: /ext3/miniforge3/bin/conda

Singularity> which python
# output: /ext3/miniforge3/bin/python

Singularity> python --version
# output: Python 3.12.9

Singularity> which pip
# output: /ext3/miniforge3/bin/pip
```
