:::

:::warning[Prerequisites]
To access the Greene HPC cluster, you must be connected to the NYU network. If you are physically on campus and connected via a wired connection in your office or through NYU’s WiFi, you can directly SSH into the clusters without any additional steps. However, if you are off-campus or working remotely, connecting through the NYU VPN or using the gateway servers is required to establish a secure connection to the HPC systems.
:::

## Secure Connections
The first step in using a cluster is to establish a connection from your computer to the cluster. When we are sitting at a computer (or standing, or holding it in our hands or on our wrists), we have come to expect a visual display with icons, widgets, and perhaps some windows or applications: a *graphical user interface*, or GUI. Since computer clusters are remote resources that we connect to over slow or intermittent interfaces (WiFi and VPNs especially), it is more practical to use a *command-line interface*, or CLI, to send commands as plain-text. If a command returns output, it is printed as plain text as well. The commands we run today will not open a window to show graphical results.

If you have ever opened the Windows Command Prompt or macOS Terminal, you have seen a CLI.  This is the CLI on your *local machine*. The only leap to be made here is to open a CLI on a *remote machine*, while taking some precautions so that other folks on the network can’t see (or change) the commands you’re running or the results the remote machine sends back. We will use the Secure SHell protocol (or SSH) to open an encrypted network connection between two machines, allowing you to send & receive text and data without having to worry about prying eyes.

![connect-to-remote](./static/connect-to-remote.svg)

SSH clients are usually command-line tools, where you provide the remote machine address as the only required argument. If your username on the remote system differs from what you use locally, you must provide that as well. If your SSH client has a graphical front-end, such as PuTTY or MobaXterm, you will set these arguments before clicking “connect.” From the terminal, you’ll write something like ssh userName@hostname, where the argument is just like an email address: the “@” symbol is used to separate the personal ID from the address of the remote machine.

When logging in to a laptop, tablet, or other personal device, a username, password, or pattern are normally required to prevent unauthorized access. In these situations, the likelihood of somebody else intercepting your password is low, since logging your keystrokes requires a malicious exploit or physical access. For systems like log-1 running an SSH server, anybody on the network can log in, or try to. Since usernames are often public or easy to guess, your password is often the weakest link in the security chain. Many clusters therefore forbid password-based login, requiring instead that you generate and configure a public-private key pair with a much stronger password. Even though Greene does not require the use SSH keys to login, please consider using the instructions below to use them.  It will make for quicker and more secure connections with Greene.

## Remote Connections with the NYU VPN & HPC Gateway Server
If you are connecting from a remote location that is not on the NYU network (your home for example), you have two options:

-   **VPN Option**: set up your computer to use the NYU VPN. Once you’ve created a VPN connection, you can proceed as if you were connected to the NYU net.
-   **Gateway Option**: go through our gateway servers (example below). Gateways are designed to support only a very minimal set of commands and their only purpose is to let users connect to HPC systems without needing to first connect to the VPN.

## Connect to the NYU VPN
To connect to VPN, please see the [NYU instructions](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/infrastructure/network-services/vpn.html).

## Log into the Greene Cluster

### Inside the NYU network (non-Windows)
From within the NYU network, that is, from an on-campus location, or after you VPN inside NYU’s network, you can log in to the HPC clusters directly. You do not need to log in to the gateway host.

To log in to the HPC cluster (Greene), simply use:
```bash
ssh <NetID>@greene.hpc.nyu.edu
```

### Outside the NYU network (non-Windows)
From an off-campus location (outside NYU-NET), logging in to the HPC clusters is a two-step process:

1.  log in to the gateway host, `gw.hpc.nyu.edu`. From a Mac or Linux workstation, this is a simple terminal command (replace `<NetID>` with your NetID). Your password is the same password you use for NYU Home:
```bash
ssh <NetID>@gw.hpc.nyu.edu
```

1.  log in to the cluster. For Greene, this is done with:
```bash
ssh <NetID>@greene.hpc.nyu.edu
```

### From Windows
Windows users will need to use PuTTY, please see the [NYU instructions](https://www.nyu.edu/employees/resources-and-services/media-and-communications/digital-communications/web-guide/website-development/tutorials/making-your-initial-connection/connecting-with-putty.html).


## Opening a Terminal
Accessing the Greene HPC cluster is primarily done through the Command Line Interface (CLI). A CLI provides a text-based environment that allows users to manage files, run programs, and navigate directories via command input. On macOS, the built-in CLI tool is Terminal, while Windows 10 users can leverage the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for similar functionality. Additionally, a popular tool for connecting to Linux servers from Windows is PuTTY, a free SSH client.

Connecting to an HPC system is most often done through a tool known as “SSH” (Secure SHell) and usually SSH is run through a terminal. So, to begin using an HPC system we need to begin by opening a terminal. Different operating systems have different terminals, none of which are exactly the same in terms of their features and abilities while working on the operating system. When connected to the remote system the experience between terminals will be identical as each will faithfully present the same experience of using that system.

Here is the process for opening a terminal in each operating system.

### Linux
There are many different versions (aka “flavours”) of Linux and how to open a terminal window can change between flavours. Fortunately most Linux users already know how to open a terminal window since it is a common part of the workflow for Linux users. If this is something that you do not know how to do then a quick search on the Internet for “how to open a terminal window in” with your particular Linux flavour appended to the end should quickly give you the directions you need.

To connect to the gateway servers, simply open a terminal application and enter the following command:
```bash
ssh <NetID>@gw.hpc.nyu.edu
```
After typing in your password you will be logged in to the cluster. Once this connection is established, you can make one more hop and connect to one of the HPC clusters:
```bash
# this will connect you to Greene HPC cluster
ssh <NetID>@greene.hpc.nyu.edu
```

### Mac
Macs have had a terminal built in since the first version of OS X, since it is built on a UNIX-like operating system, leveraging many parts from BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution). The terminal can be quickly opened through the use of the Searchlight tool. Hold down the command key and press the spacebar. In the search bar that shows up type “terminal”, choose the terminal app from the list of results (it will look like a tiny, black computer screen) and you will be presented with a terminal window. Alternatively, you can find Terminal under “Utilities” in the Applications menu in the Finder.

To connect to the gateway servers, simply open a terminal application and enter the following command:
```bash
ssh <NetID>@gw.hpc.nyu.edu
```
After typing in your password you will be logged in to the cluster. Once this connection is established, you can make one more hop and connect to Greene:
```bash
# this will connect you to Greene HPC cluster
ssh <NetID>@greene.hpc.nyu.edu
```

### Windows
While Windows does have a command-line interface known as the “Command Prompt” that has its roots in MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) it does not have an SSH tool built into it and so one needs to be installed. There are a variety of programs that can be used for this; a few common ones we describe here, as follows:

#### Git BASH
Git BASH gives you a terminal like interface in Windows. You can use this to connect to a remote computer via SSH. It can be downloaded for free from [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

#### Windows Subsystem for Linux
The Windows Subsystem for Linux also allows you to connect to a remote computer via SSH. Please see the instructions from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

#### MobaXterm
MobaXterm is a terminal window emulator for Windows and the home edition can be downloaded for free from [mobatek.net](https://mobatek.net). If you follow the link you will note that there are two editions of the home version available: Portable and Installer. The portable edition puts all MobaXterm content in a folder on the desktop (or anywhere else you would like it) so that it is easy to add plug-ins or remove the software. The installer edition adds MobaXterm to your Windows installation and menu as any other program you might install. If you are not sure that you will continue to use MobaXterm in the future, the portable edition is likely the best choice for you.

If you use MobaXterm you can use MobaKeyGen to manage your ssh keys.  Please see the MoabXterm [documentation](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/documentation.html) for details.

Download the version that you would like to use and install it as you would any other software on your Windows installation. Once the software is installed you can run it by either opening the folder installed with the portable edition and double-clicking on the executable file named MobaXterm_Personal_11.1 (your version number may vary) or, if the installer edition was used, finding the executable through either the start menu or the Windows search option.

Once the MobaXterm window is open you should see a large button in the middle of that window with the text “Start Local Terminal”. Click this button and you will have a terminal window at your disposal.

#### PuTTY

It is strictly speaking not necessary to have a terminal running on your local computer in order to access and use a remote system, only a window into the remote system once connected. PuTTY is likely the oldest, most well-known, and widely used software solution to take this approach.

PuTTY is available for [free download](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). Download the version that is correct for your operating system and install it as you would other software on your Windows system. Once installed it will be available through the start menu or similar.

You can use puttygen to create ssh keys if you are using PuTTY.  Please see the [puttygen page](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/docs.html) in the [PuTTY documentation](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.83/htmldoc/) for details.

Running PuTTY will not initially produce a terminal but instead a window full of connection options. Putting the address of the remote system in the “Host Name (or IP Address)” box and either pressing enter or clicking the “Open” button should begin the connection process.

If this works you will see a terminal window open that prompts you for a username through the “login as:” prompt and then for a password. If both of these are passed correctly then you will be given access to the system and will see a message saying so within the terminal. If you need to escape the authentication process you can hold the Control (Ctrl) key and press the c key to exit and start again.

Note that you may want to paste in your password rather than typing it. Use Ctrl plus a right-click of the mouse to paste content from the clipboard to the PuTTY terminal.

For those logging in with PuTTY it would likely be best to cover the terminal basics already mentioned above before moving on to navigating the remote system.

## Open OnDemand (Web-based Graphical User Interface)
Open OnDemand (OOD) is an open source project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). OOD is designed to create easier access for users to interface with HPC systems. Originally developed by Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), used by many universities around the world, and now servicing the NYU Greene HPC cluster.

OOD has a variety of convenient tools to manage files, access the command line, manage and monitor jobs, and launch interactive applications, such as Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio sessions, and even full Linux Desktops.

Features Include:
-   Easy file management - upload and download files, view HTML and pictures without downloading
-   Command-line shell access without any SSH client locally installed
-   Job management and monitoring
-   Full Linux desktop experience without X11
-   Interactive Apps such as JupyterHub and RStudio without the need for port forwarding

OOD is accessible to all users with a valid NYU HPC account while on-campus network or through a VPN.

To access OOD visit: [https://ood.hpc.nyu.edu](https://ood.hpc.nyu.edu) (VPN Required)

### Access the Shell
Under the clusters menu you can select the Greene Shell Access option to access the Linux shell. No local SSH client is required.

### Interactive Applications
GUI based applications are accessible without the need for port or X11 forwarding. Select the Interactive Apps menu, select the desired application, and submit the job based on required resources and options.

### Troubleshooting Connections to Open OnDemand
A common issue that can occur is receiving an error that the Open OnDemand page cannot be reached. Sometimes this can indicate that the service is down, but often this is an issue with the the local browser cache. You can test this by opening a private browser window and seeing if [https://ood.hpc.nyu.edu](https://ood.hpc.nyu.edu) will load. If it does, try deleting the cache for [https://ood.hpc.nyu.edu](https://ood.hpc.nyu.edu) in your browser history to resolve this issue.

In Chrome, this can be done by navigating to this page in your settings:

[chrome://settings/content/all?searchSubpage=ood.hpc.nyu.edu&search=site+data](chrome://settings/content/all?searchSubpage=ood.hpc.nyu.edu&search=site+data)

The link above will automatically search for the Open OnDemand site data and cookies. You can then simply click on the trashcan icon to delete the site cache.

Once done, try navigating again to [https://ood.hpc.nyu.edu](https://ood.hpc.nyu.edu) and the site should load. For other issues please email [hpc@nyu.edu](mailto:hpc@nyu.edu).

## SSH keys (optional)
SSH keys are an alternative method for authentication to obtain access to remote computing systems. They can also be used for authentication when transferring files or for accessing version control systems. In this section you will create a pair of SSH keys, a private key which you keep on your own computer and a public key which is placed on the remote HPC system that you will log into.

### Creating SSH keys on Windows
We mentioned methods for creating SSH keys using some of the [Windows SSH options above](#windows).

### Creating SSH keys on Linux, Mac and Windows Subsystem for Linux
Once you have opened a terminal check for existing SSH keys and filenames since existing SSH keys could be overwritten by the following command if the filename is the same.  If you already have a key with the name given after the `-f` option you will need to change the filename to keep from losing your existing file.

```bash
$ ls ~/.ssh/
```
then generate a new public-private key pair:
```bash
$ ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_Greene_rsa
```
-   `-o` (no default): use the OpenSSH key format, rather than PEM.
-   `-a` (default is 16): number of rounds of passphrase derivation; increase to slow down brute force attacks.
-   `-t` (default is rsa): specify the “type” or cryptographic algorithm.
-   `-b` (default is 2048): sets the number of bits in the key.
-   `-f` (default is /home/user/.ssh/id_algorithm): filename to store your keys. If you already have SSH keys, make sure you specify a different name: ssh-keygen will overwrite the default key if you don’t specify!

When prompted, enter a strong password that you will remember. Cryptography is only as good as the weakest link, and this will be used to connect to a powerful, precious, computational resource.

Take a look in `~/.ssh` (use `ls ~/.ssh`). You should see the two new files: your private key (`~/.ssh/key_Greene_rsa`) and the public key (`~/.ssh/key_Greene_rsa.pub`). If a key is requested by the system administrators, the _public_ key is the one to provide.

:::danger
Private keys are your private identity

A private key that is visible to anyone but you should be considered compromised, and must be destroyed. This includes having improper permissions on the directory it (or a copy) is stored in, traversing any network in the clear, attachment on unencrypted email, and even displaying the key (which is ASCII text) in your terminal window.

Protect this key as if it unlocks your front door. In many ways, it does.

### SSH Agent for Easier Key Handling
An SSH key is only as strong as the password used to unlock it, but on the other hand, typing out a complex password every time you connect to a machine is tedious and gets old very fast. This is where the SSH Agent comes in.

Using an SSH Agent, you can type your password for the private key once, then have the Agent remember it for some number of hours or until you log off. Unless some nefarious actor has physical access to your machine, this keeps the password safe, and removes the tedium of entering the password multiple times.

Just remember your password, because once it expires in the Agent, you have to type it in again.

#### SSH Agents on Linux, macOS, and Windows
Open your terminal application and check if an agent is running:
```bash
[user@laptop ~]$ ssh-add -l
```
If you get an error like this one,
:::danger[Error]
Error connecting to agent: No such file or directory
:::
…   then you need to launch the agent as follows:
```bash
[user@laptop ~]$ eval $(ssh-agent)
```
:::note[What’s in a $(...)?]
The syntax of this SSH Agent command is unusual, based on what we’ve seen in the UNIX Shell tutorial. This is because the ssh-agent command creates opens a connection that only you have access to, and prints a series of shell commands that can be used to reach it – but *does not execute them*!
```bash
[user@laptop ~]$ ssh-agent
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-Zvvga2Y8kQZN/agent.131521;
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;
SSH_AGENT_PID=131522;
export SSH_AGENT_PID;
echo Agent pid 131522;
```
The `eval` command interprets this text output as commands and allows you to access the SSH Agent connection you just created.

You could run each line of the `ssh-agent` output yourself, and achieve the same result. Using `eval` just makes this easier.
:::
-   Otherwise, your agent is already running: don’t mess with it.

Add your key to the agent, with session expiration after 8 hours:
```bash
[user@laptop ~]$ ssh-add -t 8h ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Enter passphrase for .ssh/id_ed25519:
Identity added: .ssh/id_ed25519
Lifetime set to 86400 seconds
```
For the duration (8 hours), whenever you use that key, the SSH Agent will provide the key on your behalf without you having to type a single keystroke.

#### SSH Agent on PuTTY
If you are using PuTTY on Windows, download and use `pageant` as the SSH agent. See the [PuTTY documentation](./02_connecting_to_hpc.mdx#opening-a-terminal).


## Modifying your .ssh/config file
Please add the following lines to your `~/.ssh/config` file:
```
Host greene.hpc.nyu.edu dtn.hpc.nyu.edu gw.hpc.nyu.edu
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  ServerAliveInterval 60
  ForwardAgent yes
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  LogLevel ERROR

Host hpcgwtunnel
  HostName gw.hpc.nyu.edu
  ForwardX11 no
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  LocalForward 8027 greene.hpc.nyu.edu:22
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  User <Your NetID>

Host greene
  HostName localhost
  Port 8027
  ForwardX11 yes
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  LogLevel ERROR
  User <Your NetID>
```
You'll need to replace the sections above labelled `<Your NetID>` with your NetID.  You can find more details about this at the [Quickstart section of Accessing HPC at NYU](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/accessing-hpc#h.7t97br4zzvip)

## Logging onto the system
With all of this in mind, let’s connect to our remote HPC system. In this tutorial, we will connect to Greene — an HPC system located at New York University. Although it’s unlikely that every system will be exactly like Greene, it’s a very good example of what you can expect from an HPC installation. To connect to Greene we will use SSH (if you are using PuTTY see [details above](./02_connecting_to_hpc.mdx#opening-a-terminal)).

SSH allows us to connect to UNIX computers remotely, and use them as if they were our own. The general syntax of the connection command follows the format:
```bash
ssh yourUsername@some.computer.address
```

Let’s attempt to connect to the HPC system now:

If you'd like to connect without typing your password you'll need to copy your public key file to greene first:
```bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_Greene_rsa.pub <NetID>@greene.hpc.nyu.edu:/home/<NetID>
```

You'll need to log in with your password at least once even if you plan to use SSH keys in the future because we'll need to set up your keys.

If you are on NYU WiFi or VPN you can connect directly with:
```bash
ssh <NetID>@greene.hpc.nyu.edu
```

otherwise, you'll need to go through the NYU gateway first:

```bash
ssh <NetID>@gw.hpc.nyu.edu
ssh <NetID>@greene.hpc.nyu.edu
```

When you are logged in you will see information about your last login, the host you've connected to, and your storage quota.  It should look something like this:

```bash
Last login: Fri May  9 09:45:18 2025 from 0.0.0.0

Hostname: log-1 at Mon May 12 10:48:19 EDT 2025

Filesystem   Environment   Backed up?   Allocation       Current Usage
Space        Variable      /Flushed?    Space / Files    Space(%) / Files(%)

/home        $HOME         Yes/No       50.0GB/30.0K      23.74GB(47.48%)/4913(16.38%)
/scratch     $SCRATCH      No/Yes        5.0TB/1.0M      35.91GB(0.70%)/19585(1.96%)
/archive     $ARCHIVE      Yes/No        2.0TB/20.0K       0.00GB(0.00%)/1(0.00%)
/vast        $VAST         NO/YES        2TB/5.0M           0.0TB(0.0%)/2(0%)

[NetID@log-1 ~]$
```

By looking at the information after *Hostname:* and in the prompt you'll notice that the machine you're currently logged into is not Greene.  This is expected.  You've just logged into a _login node_ that is connected to Greene.  It is from the login nodes that you will submit jobs to Greene.

If you logged in using PuTTY this will not apply because it does not offer a local terminal.

### Setting up your SSH keys (optional)

If you copied your SSH keys to your home directory in an earlier step, we'll guide you through setting them up for use now.
1.   If you do not have a directory name `.ssh` in your home directory create one now with the command: `mkdir ~/.ssh`
    - Remember you can list the hidden (dot) files by running the command: `ls -a`
2. add your key to the list of `authorized_keys` with the command: `cat ~/id_Greene_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

That’s all! Disconnect, then try to log back into the remote: if your key and agent have been configured correctly, you should not be prompted for the password.

### Telling the Difference between the Local Terminal and the Remote Terminal

You can see that the prompt has changed after you log into a remote system.  Let's take a closer look at the prompt after login: `[NetID@log-1 ~]$` (in this example) tells us that we are logged into the login node `log-1` with the identity `NetID`.

This change presents a small complication that we will need to navigate throughout this workshop. Exactly what is reported before the `$` in the terminal when it is connected to the local system and the remote system will typically be different for every user. We still need to indicate which system we are entering commands on though so we will adopt the following convention:

-   `[local]$` when the command is to be entered on a terminal connected to your local computer
-   `[NetID@glogin-1 ~]$` when the command is to be entered on a terminal connected to the remote system
-   `$` when it really doesn’t matter which system the terminal is connected to

### Being certain which system your terminal is connected to
If you ever need to be certain which system a terminal you are using is connected to then use the following command: 
```bash
$ hostname
```

### Keep two terminal windows open
It is strongly recommended that you have two terminals open, one connected to the local system and one connected to the remote system that you can switch back and forth between. If you only use one terminal window then you will need to reconnect to the remote system using one of the methods above when you see a change from `[local]$` to `[NetID@login-1 ~]$` and disconnect when you see the reverse.
