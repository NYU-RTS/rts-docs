# Start here!

We encourage you to setup your own computational environment on Torch and to assist you in doing so, we allow you to run [Apptainer](../07_containers/01_intro.md) (formerly known as Singularity) containers, we manage licensed software suites and offer extensive documentation, training and support.

:::tip
We stongly advise that you setup your own computational enviromments via Apptainer containers and overlay files. Detailed documentation is available in the [containers section](../07_containers/01_intro.md).
