# Python Packages with Virtual Environments


:::tip
This page describes how you can create virtual environments without containers in `$SCRATCH`/`/home/$USER`. We strongly encourage you to create your computational environments within Overlay files attached to Apptainer containers [as described in this section](../07_containers/03_singularity_with_conda.md). Please note that creating both kinds of conda environments is strongly discouraged as it leads to packages from one environment being accidentally used in another.
:::


In order to be able to install new Python packages and make your work reproducible, please use virtual environments. There is more than one way to create a private environment in Python.

## Create project directory and load Python module
```sh
## Find python version you need
module avail python
## created directory for your project and cd there
mkdir /scratch/$USER/my_project
cd /scratch/$USER/my_project
## load python module (different versions available)
module load  python/intel/3.8.6
```

## Automatic deletion of your files
This page describes the installation of packages on /scratch. One has to remember, though, that files stored in the HPC scratch file system are subject to the HPC Scratch old file purging policy: <br />

<summary>
**Automatic deletion of your files**
Files on the `/scratch` file system that have not been accessed for 60 or more days will be purged (see [HPC Storage](../03_storage/01_intro_and_data_management.mdx) for details). Click to see how you can work around this limitation.
</summary>

Thus you can consider the following options:

-   Reinstall your packages if some of the files get deleted
    -   You can do this manually 
    -   You can do this automatically. For example, within a workflow of a pipeline software like [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
-   Pay for "Research Project Space" - for details see [Research Project Space](../03_storage/05_research_project_space.mdx)

## Create virtual environment
It is advisable to create private environment inside the project directory. This boosts reproducibility and does not use space in `/home/$USER`:
```sh
## created directory for your project and cd there
mkdir /scratch/$USER/my_project
cd /scratch/$USER/my_project
```

### `virtualenv`
[`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is a tool to create isolated Python environments. Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the venv module. You can create new virtual environment in two ways:
-   empty
```sh
## Create an EMPTY virtual environment
virtualenv venv
```
-   inherit all packages from those installed on HPC already (and available in PATH after you load python module)
```sh
## Create an virtual environment that inherits system packages
virtualenv venv --system-site-packages
```

### `venv`
[`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is package shipped with Python. It provides subset of options available in virtualenv tool ([link](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)).
```sh
python -m venv venv
```

Create new virtual environment in current directory:
-   empty
```sh
## (use venv command to create environment called "venv")

python -m venv venv
```
-   inherit all packages from those installed on HPC already (and available in PATH after you load python module)
```sh
## Inhering all packages
python -m venv venv --system-site-packages
```

## Install packages. Keep things reproducible
```sh
## activate
source venv/bin/activate
## install packages
pip install <package you need>
## If package was inherited, but you want to install it in your own env anyway
pip install <package you need> --ignore-installed
## export list of packages (to report together with paper and/or to reproduce environment on another computer)
pip freeze > requirements.txt
## restore
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Close an Activated Virtual Environment
If you have activated a virtual environment, you can exit it with the following command:
```sh
deactivate
```

## Use with sbatch
When you use this env in sbatch script, please use
```sh
module purge;
source venv/bin/activate;
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK;
python python_script.py
```

If you use mpi
```sh
mpiexec bash -c "module purge;
                 source venv/bin/activate;
                 export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK;
                 python python_script.py"
```
