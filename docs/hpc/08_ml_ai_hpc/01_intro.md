# Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) on HPC

Many people are interested in running ML and/or AI workflows on the HPC resources.  To help facilitate this we have created this section that will provide examples of how one might use our resources for ML and AI tasks.

For ML we'll cover two prominent open-source deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow.  We'll show how to start with a single GPU example and then show more sophisticated examples. 

For AI we'll cover how to run a Hugging Face Large Language Model (LLM) and how to fine tune an LLM.
