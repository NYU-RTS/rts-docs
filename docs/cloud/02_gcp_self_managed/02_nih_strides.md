# NIH Strides

[nih-strides]: https://cloud.nih.gov/

The NIH Science and Technology Research Infrastructure for Discovery, Experimentation, and Sustainability ([STRIDES][nih-strides]) Initiative allows NIH to explore the use of cloud environments to streamline NIH data use by partnering with commercial providers (GCP/AWS). The NIH STRIDES Initiative:
-   Provides biomedical researchers with access to advanced, cost-effective cloud computing infrastructure, tools, and resources
-   Enable researchers to work collaboratively in the cloud by establishing an interconnected ecosystem of biomedical research data
-   Equip researchers with emerging cloud solutions for data management & computation to enable experimentation and innovation

The benefits of participating in NIH Strides program include:
-   Pre-negotiated favorable pricing for cloud services
-   Access to training to help researchers harness the power of the cloud
-   Receive opportunities for professional service engagements to help drive success
-   Receive guidance for best practices in areas such as data storage, governance, and controlled access

## Enrolling to the NIH Strides initiative

NYU has enrolled in the NIH Strides initiative in December 2020 by signing an agreement with Carahsoft, GCP's billing and administrative partner. Thus NIH-funded NYU researchers with an active NIH award may take advantage of the STRIDES Initiative for their NIH-funded research projects. The NYU RTS team works closely with Burwood Group, a GCP reseller, to provide access to GCP resources for NYU researchers who are approved to participate in the NIH STRIDES initiative. NYU researchers who wish to participate must follow the steps outlined below.
