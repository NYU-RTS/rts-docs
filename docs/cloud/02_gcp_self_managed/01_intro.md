We facilitate access to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for your research projects. NYU is a member of the [Internet2 Net+ GCP program][internet2-gcp] that allows for community-negotiated GCP terms that provides NYU researchers with benefits that include, amongst other things, price discounts, [waivers for data egress fees][waive-egress], and [NIH STRIDES][nih-strides] initiative benefits.

In addition to the I2 Net+ GCP benefits, NYU scholars can enjoy significant discounts in using GCP resources in their research project through a 3 year commitment (started in 2019) NYU made in GCP. The NYU network connects with GCP via Partner Interconnect using [Internet2 Cloud Connect (I2CC)][internet2-cc] service.

## Why work with the NYU Research Cloud team to deploy your research project on GCP?

NYU researchers who work with the Research Cloud team to deploy projects on GCP may benefit from the following:
-   Discounted rates, lower GCP project cost:  Through NYU's participation in the Internet2 Net+ agreement, as well as the 3-year commitment NYU made to using GCP, GCP projects enjoy discounted rates, lowering the cost of the project. The exact discounts depend on the GCP service used in the research project and can vary between 5% and 25%. Free data egress is usually included.
-   GCP Expertise and project setup: The NYU research cloud team can work closely with researchers to Identity and Access Management, groups access, establish billing, etc.
-   GCP Support cases: Given proper permissions the NYU Research Cloud team can open support cases on behalf of the researchers or directly discuss GCP project issues with GCP experts
-   Cost monitoring, billing alerts, and spending reports: The Research Cloud team has access to additional tools that can provide cost monitoring, switch between billing options and provide spending reports.
-   Research project funding options: The NYU research cloud team can help with providing invoices, internal fund transfers, establishing GCP Billing ids, etc. that can enable NYU researchers to pay for GCP services.

## Getting Started with GCP
There are a number of ways you can get started with using GCP in research projects:
-   To start using GCP resources in a research project, request a consultation with the Research Cloud team (via email research-cloud-support@nyu.edu). The Research Cloud team can advise on ways to set up your research project, available discounts, etc.
-   If a project involves Data Science and Machine Learning, consult with the DS3 team before starting your project on GCP.
Please note:
-   Creating a GCP project using your NYU account (NetID@nyu.edu) will place the project under the nyu.edu organization, an environment managed by the NYU Research Cloud team. However, your project doesn't automatically qualify for the price discounts and benefits that NYU has negotiated with GCP.
-   For non-NYU work on GCP, please use your personal, non-NYU, Google email when creating GCP projects.

The NYU Research Cloud team does not currently offer training on how to deploy and utilize resources on GCP in research projects or teaching. If you are new to GCP and you want to learn the GCP fundamentals or if you want to learn how to perform specific tasks on GCP (obtain skill badges), please consider the following resources:
-   Through the [Google For Education][google-for-edu] program, GCP offers training credits and discounts to Students, Faculty, and IT Admins. To apply for training credits and discounts, please [click here](https://services.google.com/fb/forms/googlecloudskillsbooststudenttrainingcreditsapplication/).
-   [Getting started with Google Cloud Platform][gcp-get-started] offers quick starts and sample projects on GCP.

## How can I fund my research project on GCP?
### GCP Free Tier
Apply for credits using your NYU account (https://cloud.google.com/free/). After credits expire, if you would like to switch to another type of funding and are approved to do so, we will modify your project so it can use other funds:
-   https://edu.google.com/programs/credits/research/?modal_active=none
-   https://edu.google.com/programs/?modal_active=none
