## Who is eligible for to access Pythia?
All full-time NYU faculty have the ability to request the creation of workspaces by filling out [the research intake form][research-workspace-request]. Once we create the workspace, members need to submit the [member on-boarding form][member-onboarding-form] to gain access to the workspace. Please be sure to indicate the models you'd like access to from the [catalouge](../03_external_llms/01_catalogue.md)


:::info
Policies for access to non-research workflows (instruction/administrative) are being worked upon. For now, you can request the creation of workspaces for instruction/administraton uses via the same intake form for research [here][research-workspace-request].
