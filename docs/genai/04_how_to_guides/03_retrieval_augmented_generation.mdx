# Retrieval-augmented generation

Large Language Models only know about the data they were trained upon and do not have the context needed to be effective at answering questions based on:
- private datasets
- newer knowledge past the cutoff date (i.e. the date at which data collection was frozen)

To get around this issue, one of the most popular techniques is Retrieval-augmented generation, the most basic version of which is outlined below:

```mermaid
flowchart TB;
    A["Documents to use in RAG pipeline"]
    B@{shape: docs, label: "Document parsed and divided into multiple chunks"}
    C["encoder-only LLM"]
    D@{shape: procs, label: "text chunk embedding"}
    E[("vector database")]
    F["natual language prompt"]
    G["query embedding"]
    I["relevant chunks"]
    J["original prompt with added context"]
    K["relevant response from LLM using context"]
    subgraph Ingestion
    A-- "Parse and Chunk" -->B;
    end
    subgraph Embeddings
    B-- "Pass to embedding model" -->C;
    C-- "Generate Embeddings" -->D;
    D-- "Store Emebddings" -->E;
    end
    subgraph Retrieval
    F-- "Pass to embedding model" -->C;
    C-- "Generate Emebddings" -->G;
    G-- "Query vector database" -->E;
    E-- "Gather text chunks with embeddings similar to prompt" -->I;
    end
    I-- "With expanded prompt" -->J;
    subgraph Augmented Generation
    J-- "LLM" -->K;
    end
```

It starts with the "Ingestion" phase where a document to be used as context is parsed and broken into chunks. These chunks are then converted to embeddings and stored in a vector database (which specializes in storing and retrieving vectors). This setup allows us now "retrieve" the required context for an incoming prompt before it is sent to an LLM. The "retrieval" phase consists of converting the prompt to an embedding and looking up embeddings for chunks of the document that are similar to it. The text chunks associated with the embeddings similar to the embedding for the query are then added as additional context to the prompt before passing it to an LLM.
The LLM now has the associated context it needs to generate an relevant response to the prompt.

Here's a script to test this out yourself, once you have API access to an embedding model and an LLM: https://github.com/NYU-RTS/rts-docs-examples/tree/main/genai/rag . You can run it to ask a question about a recent event that occurred after the knowledge cutoff for the dataset used to train the LLM:
```sh
ss19980@ITS-JQKQGQQMTX ~/D/p/r/g/rag (main)> uv run rag_basic.py \
                                                 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_London_Marathon \
                                                 "Which athletes won the 2025 London Marathon?"
