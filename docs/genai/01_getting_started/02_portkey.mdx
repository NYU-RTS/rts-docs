Broadly it facilitates:
-   **Route requests** via configurations that can allow for fallbacks, load balance, etc
-   **Observability** via the control pane that displays your usage statistics and logs. You can retrieve your logs via an API.
-   **Prompt management** via the prompt playground. You can compare the response for a prompt across multiple LLMs, collaborate with your team and export your prompts.
-   **Guardrails** usage by allowing you to define them or integrate with third party guardrails.
-   **Agentic workflows** by integrating with various agentic frameworks like langchain, llamaindex, etc.
-   **Security & Governance** by allowing you to set budget and rate limits on the API keys created for your workspace
