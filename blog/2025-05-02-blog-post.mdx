We are pleased to announce that `o4-mini` is now available via Pythia. Here is an overview of the model: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o4-mini

When compared to `o3-mini`, `o4-mini` adds support for images as inputs. It costs the same as o3-mini for regular usage, though the price is lower if you use cached inputs. Thus, this model will now be the default reasoning model we provide and the use of o3-mini is now deprecated.
